A Virtual Machine translation unit for a VM language to the Hack machine language.

Specification is in the book, The elements of computing fundementals.

Here is the layout of the program (sort of), non comprehensive of functions,
but it contians the general layout of the different modules.



Modules:

Parser Module - parses the given VM file into an easier to work with internal datastructure.

- Interface
    parserInitialize() - takes a file name / path which is mmaped into memory
    parserDestroy() - destroys the parser and unmaps the file
    parserParseCommands() - given a stack arena allocator and a command_module structure 
                            parse the commands contained within the mmaped file the parser
                            holds. The memeory in the given command_module have the lifetime
                            of the given stack arena and are controlled by it.
    
Parser structure
    - mmaped file pointer
    - mmaped file size


Command Module - contains structures and functions regarding parsed vm commands

Command Module structure
    - Array of command structures
    - total commands
    - array of indexes where functions begin - not used currently, for later

Command structure
    - holds the command
    - holds the commands operands
